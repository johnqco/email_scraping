# email_scraping
A small program to scrap emails using selenium and google dorks.

To run the program you have to install first the selenium librairy by typing this in your cmd : ```pip install selenium```.

Then, to run the program, type : ```python3 mail-scraping.py```.

*Make sure that python 3 is installed on your computer.*

This project is still under developpement, so there might have some errors. I will improve the program to scrap the results on a custom number of result pages.
